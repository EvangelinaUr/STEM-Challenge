This Python script uses the turtle module to draw a festive outdoor scene that includes:  A house with a colored base, brown roof, door, and windows  Green trees and a Christmas tree with a trunk and star decorations  A blue sky background with a white sun  Flying birds using turtle stamps  Randomly placed stars in the sky.
